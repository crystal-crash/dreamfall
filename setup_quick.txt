install node.js & npm for ur platform

here's what i did, hopefully it works for u:

npm install
npm audit fix
npm run start-local [it errors out]
cd ./node_modules/electron/dist
sudo chown root ./chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod 4755 ./chrome-sandbox
cd ../../..
npm run start-local [should work, opening program and browser control API]

during testing it initially logged me into the web terminal as 'admin' and prompted for the un/pw and let me enter 'sleep,' 'sleep', now it shows 'operator' and doesn't prompt. idk. maybe i screwed something up a little or made a simple oversight or something, idk. at any rate "It works on my machine" is all i can really say, more or less. apologies for all flaws and deficiencies

good luck anyone who uses this!
